This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Accepts two integer inputs from the user
- Supports the following operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Handles division by zero with an error message
- Provides clear output for each operation

## Usage
1. Run the program using Python:
   ```sh
   python Calculator.py
   ```
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Enter the desired operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
5. View the result or error message.

## Example
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): *
10 * 5 = 50
```
